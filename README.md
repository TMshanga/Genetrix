# Genetrix
Written in Java with JavaFX, Genetrix is a personal desktop Wiki-style application specifically designed for story creation and idea organisation. Utilising the JavaFX HTML Editor, users may create blank pages or use templates, and highlight text that can then be used to link to other pages by double clicking. Pages are stored in a tree format and can be manipulated and moved around. Features currently include themes, spell-checking and suggestions, rich text editing, image insertion and styling, exporting to HTML and more. The project is currently in it's early stages and it's strongly advised that you save frequently and create many backups of your projects.
